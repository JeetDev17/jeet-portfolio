VR Educational Center: Khodiyar CAD Courses
Project Summary: The Virtual Learning Hub
This project transforms the traditional course catalog and information center into a fully immersive VR experience for prospective and current students of Khodiyar CAD Center. Utilizing a custom-built virtual auditorium, the application allows users to naturally explore course details, placement records, and center information through intuitive VR interactions, enhancing engagement far beyond a standard website or brochure.

Key Features & Technical Highlights
Native XR Interaction & Input: Implemented the Meta XR SDK to support dual interaction modes: precise Hand Tracking (hand gestures) and standard Controller Interaction, ensuring broad accessibility and a natural user experience.

Intuitive Navigation System: Developed the OVRPlayer Camera Rig and custom scripting to enable seamless movement and primary interaction within the virtual environment.

Dynamic Information Display (Curve UI):

Designed and implemented Multiple Curve UI panels for aesthetic and functional display of content (like 'About Us,' 'Placement').

Scripted Horizontal Scroll Curve UI elements to neatly present large amounts of data, such as the full course catalog (e.g., AutoCAD, SolidWorks).

Interactive Content Grouping: Utilized a Multiple Tab Group Scripting system to manage and switch between distinct informational categories (Mechanical, Civil, Graphics) cleanly, improving content organization.

Environmental Fidelity & Immersion: Achieved high visual quality and performance through detailed Lighting and Environment Setup, including the use of Baked Area Lights to simulate realistic light distribution.

Multimedia Integration: Seamlessly integrated Video Player functionality into the curved UI displays for engaging presentation of promotional or course-specific media.

Spatial Audio Design: Enhanced immersion with context-sensitive audio, featuring a Welcome Surround Sound system and an Intro Sound for Details to provide clear, spatialized user feedback.
